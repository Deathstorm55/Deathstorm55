## 🚀 About Me

Hi, I'm a passionate Full Stack Engineer and Computer Science enthusiast undergraduate from the Federal University Oye-Ekiti. I specialize in building user-focused, innovative web applications using technologies like JavaScript, PHP, Laravel, MySQL, and React. My projects include a CRUD-based Scholarship Tracker platform, a geo-enabled Eco-Facility Locator System (Ecolobby), and a Screen Time Limiter App developed with Python and Electron, all leveraging MVC architecture and OOP principles.

I have a strong interest in creating educational tools, such as my Igbara Quiz App, a dynamic quiz platform for students with admin and student interfaces, built using SQL, PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’m dedicated to enhancing user experiences, evident in my focus on secure signup/login functionalities with password hashing and session management, as well as responsive designs for accessibility across devices.

Beyond web development, I’ve explored Natural Language Processing, fine-tuning a model for Yoruba Named Entity Recognition (achieving an F1-score of 0.87) and developing a Python-based chatbot using the Transformers library and Streamlit. I thrive in agile environments, utilizing tools like Git and Docker to streamline development.

I’m also curious about the broader tech landscape, from understanding computer hardware and software to safe online practices like using strong passwords and recognizing secure websites. My creative side shines through in my interest in digital aesthetics, such as designing visuals with moody, high-contrast themes.

I’m always eager to learn, innovate, and contribute to impactful projects, bringing both technical expertise and a commitment to user-centric solutions.
